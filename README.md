# SwaggerTestService
A simple test service generated by the "delegate" version of Swagger codegen, and a separate project containing the API implementation code.

There are a couple of oddities:

1) I had to manually add scala-library.jar to the project pom.xml. I'm not sure why Swagger isn't getting that dependency in the normal way. (I'm extremely new to Maven, Swagger, Jetty, etc.)

2) I have not been able to figure out how to get logging to work correctly. Jetty always complains about log4j not being configured correctly, even though I thought I did that by supplying a log4j.properties in testsvc/jaxrs/main/resources.
